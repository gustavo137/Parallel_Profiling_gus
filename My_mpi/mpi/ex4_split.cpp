/*
1)  The processes' outputs might seem out of sequence. This is common because the different communicators run in parallel,
    and the timing of when each process prints its result isn't synchronized.
    Each communicator is broadcasting correctly, but since the printing is happening asynchronously, the order of
    the outputs is not linear. This behavior is expected in parallel computing environments like MPI.
2)  If you want the output to appear in order (rank 0 first, then rank 1, etc.), you could force the processes to synchronize
    before printing, using MPI_Barrier or ordering print statements carefully. However, this would be purely for clarity in
    viewing the output and doesn't affect the correctness of the broadcasts.
